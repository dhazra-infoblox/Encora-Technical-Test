1. Exposing a websocket server to a browser for server push communication

Ans: Gorilla WebSocket because of its API stability and actively maintained packages

2. Parsing an xml file (DOM or SAX, when do you choose which?)

Ans: encoding/xml . Can be used in DOM mode where you ask the library to parse the entire 
document in one shot into a single object. The SAX functionality is available via Token method.
If you feed an XML document to the parser and use nothing but the Token method to read it,
You get a SAX-style parser.

3. An embedded Key Value store which would typically have ~100mb of data and be 99% reads

Ans: Bolt DB by Ben Johnson as it's simple to use, fast and reliable. 

4. A system to auto-discover other instances of a service on the same network

Ans: Netflix Eureka, as its very easy to use and manage. We first register all our clients 
to the discovery server when they are up. This eases the monitoring of all the servers and 
their replicas in case we are using a load balancer.
